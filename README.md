# Steam gaming analysis challenge

by Sebastian Wolf

## Content
The repo is organized in four folders:
- `data`: place the [data](https://storage.googleapis.com/datatonic-steam-gaming-challenge/steam_gaming_large.zip) here
- `code`: holds all notebooks, utility .py files, and notebooks saved as htmls for easy viewing
- `docker` : a dockerfile to re-create the environment I used
- `html_maps` : a map output showing gamers geographical distribution

## Solution
My solution to the challenge is split in three notebooks:
- data_engineering.ipynb
- analytics.ipynb
- advanced.ipynb

The `code` folder also include html versions of these notebooks.

For the *analytics* challenge (Exercise 2), I created a slide set [here](./code/analytics.slides.html).
