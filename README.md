# Steam gaming analysis challenge

by Sebastian Wolf

## Content
The repo is organized in four folders:
- `data`: place the [data](https://storage.googleapis.com/datatonic-steam-gaming-challenge/steam_gaming_large.zip) here
- `code`: holds all notebooks, utility .py files, and notebooks saved as htmls for easy viewing
- `docker` : a dockerfile to re-create the environment I used
- `html_maps` : a map output showing gamers geographical distribution

## Solution
My solution to the challenge is split in three notebooks:
- [data_engineering.ipynb](./code/data_engineering.ipynb) - (Exercsie 1)
- [analytics.ipynb](./code/analytics.ipynb) - (Exercsie 2)
- [advanced.ipynb](./code/advanced.ipynb) - (Exercsie 3)

The `code` folder also includes html versions of these notebooks.

For the **analytics** challenge (Exercise 2), I created a slide set [analytics.slides.html](./code/analytics.slides.html).
